The minor mod, coded by Alex Jelus, is a speed boost. By holding the space bar, the player's movement speed is tripled.
Extra UI was added to the CaughtImageBackground canvas to teach players how to sprint if they are caught.

The major mod, coded by Dylan Torres, involves mini-map functionality. A second camera was added in the game view, showing
an overhead view of the entire map. This includes the main character, John Lemon, who now has a high-priority light green 
spotlight by his feet for better readability. The enemies are also visible on the mini-map, but to maintain a consistent
sense of challenge with the original version, these enemies do not feature a spotlight tracking their position. The post-
processing effects apply to the second camera as well as the first, making the visual style more consistent overall.
